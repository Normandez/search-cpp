# search-cpp
C++ Realizations of Searching Algorithms

# Algorithms
* LinearSearch - simpliest search algo, just iterate through whole array and compare each value, O(n)
* BinarySearch - input array should be sorted, split array on two halves, compare middle with searching value, if not equals, narrow distance to lower or higher half and repeat until half length not 0, O(logn)

# Usage example
Ready usage example in main.cpp
